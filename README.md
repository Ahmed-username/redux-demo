# Redux exercise

We have a YouTube app which allows us to search YouTube videos and play them by clicking on the result. In this exercise we want to convert it to use Redux.

## Tasks

> "Weeks of programming can save hours of planning"

- Working in pairs, fork and clone the repo
- Take a look at the code first to understand the data flow and which components are responsible for which behaviour.
- Using pen and paper draw a diagram of current data flow.
- Plan out what data you want to store in your Redux store.
- Decide what containers you will need to power your presentational components
- Plan what reducers and actions you will need.
- Decide on a plan what order you will implement your application in. Aim to implement a small part using Redux and expand it small steps at a time. Make sure you test frequently.
- Please confirm plan with Dmitri or Oliver before moving to implementation phase.

Commit frequently. Push your code at the end and create a pull requests.
